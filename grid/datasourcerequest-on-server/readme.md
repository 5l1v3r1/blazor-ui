# Use Telerik DataSourceRequest and DataSourceResult on the server

These two sample projects showcase how you can send the Telerik component state (such as the grid's `DataSourceRequet` object from the `OnRead` event) to the server, so you can retrieve and shape the data easily.

The serialization for an HTTP request (needed for a WASM) project is available as of the `2.11.0` release.

Review the individual projects, the comments in the code and their own readme files for details on each approach.
