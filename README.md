The projects usually reference a commercial version of UI for Blazor. If you only have a trial license, replace the reference to the NuGet package and to the JS Interop file [accordingly]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}).

The references (both to Telerik UI for Blazor, and the .NET framework) are usually up-to-date for the time of creation. You may need to update to their latest versions and make any necessary changes. The Blazor framework is evolving rapidly and these examples may not get their references updated all the time. Nevertheless, the general approaches should remain valid, barring breaking changes in the framework.
